# English to A'mas'kan Live Translator
This repository also includes all of the code for our live translator that converts both speech and text in English to A'mas'kan.  

To get the translator up and running, there are some dependecies you will need to install.  

These include the following packages:  
1. re
2. speech_recognition

You can install these by typing them directly into terminal/cmd or through an IDE (like Pycharm)  

To run our prototype translator:  
1. Install the EngToA'mas'kan.py file
2. Open the file in Pycharm (or other IDE) and it should be ready to go
3. Run the file and if all dependencies are there, you should have a English to A'mas'kan Translator to help you learn our language! 

*Just a note, the speech_recognition library is not the best in the world, it sometimes makes mistakes!

Thank you and have fun conlanging!
